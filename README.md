MedPort is a smart healthcare tool that revolutionizes personal healthcare management. It securely stores supplements and medications, and tracks users when and how much to take through an interactive app. Featuring a password-protected keypad and fingerprint authentication, it ensures safety while integrating local AI to process biometric data for real-time health analytics. Unlike cloud-based solutions, MedPort prioritizes confidentiality, helping users find suitable doctors without exposing sensitive data and processing such data locally to empower them to communicate properly and with full transparency. MedPort is the first to use AI agents for personalized doctor recommendations, solving major healthcare gaps.

## Why

Communication failures negatively affect patient outcomes in healthcare. For example, misdiagnoses and other medical mistakes that can easily lead to avoidable health complications and the death of patients. CRICO Strategies, a renowned healthcare research body, investigated 23,000 medical malpractice lawsuits and found more than 7,000 of those lawsuits could be attributed to communication failures. It resulted in $1.7 billion accumulated in malpractice costs and 2,000 preventable deaths. In fact, study conducted by the Joint Commission found 80% of serious medical errors were the result of miscommunication between caregivers during patient handovers. While these problems are prevalent in the healthcare industry, private and local AI models-which process data locally rather than relying on cloud servers- is emerging, and an equitable solution to many of these problems in healthcare. MedPort is aimed to reduce medical errors, strengthen data privacy, enhances preventative care, and tracks medicinal usage.

## How

MedMind is a dual system with smart AI-powered medicine cabinet combined with a local AI health assistant that ensures secure medication management, health tracking, and doctor connectivity—all while prioritizing data privacy.

### 1. Medication Management

- Users input their medications and supplements into the MedMind mobile or web app.
- The system stores this data on a local database.
- The system sends reminders for when and how much to take.
- Interactive LED indicators light up inside the cabinet, guiding users to the correct pill.
- A keypad and fingerprint scanner ensure only authorized access, preventing misuse.

### 2. AI-Powered Health Assistance (Local AI, Not Cloud-Based)

- Generates health reports: AI synthesizes medical data into digestible insights for doctors.
- Doctor matchmaking: Uses generative AI and AI agents to find suitable doctors nearby based on the user’s medical needs.

### 3. Privacy-Focused AI Processing

- Unlike cloud-based AI, MedMind uses on-device processing using containerization to run assistant models locally to ensure biometric and medical data remain private.
- Eliminates the risks of data leaks, third-party surveillance, and unauthorized selling of health data.

## What

### Key Features

**Medication Management**: users log their medications (e.g. supplements, medication, over-the-counter, etc.) in the MedMind web or mobile app. The user logs by clicking a button to indicate their action of needing to take a dosage, and then a distinct LED will provide a visual aid for locating the corresponding medication.
**Secure Access**: equipped with a keypad lock and fingerprint scanner
**Local AI Healthcare Assistant**: processes biometric data locally, provides real-time analytics, and generates insightful reports for doctors
**Doctor Matchmaking and Outreach**: the local AI assistant uses web search agents to find the accessible healthcare options based on patterns detected from user activity and attached medical history. Note: no data will be sent to the web, it is only used to craft a query that gets sent to the web
**Privacy-Focused AI**: unlike traditional cloud-based health apps, MedMind ensures confidentiality by processing data on-device with models through software like Ollama—preventing data leaks or third-party surveillance
Wearable Integration: This will enhance the project, but it is not required.

This project is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Therefore, with our algorithms, we always advise to seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. We empower uses to get help matching to a doctor, reaching out to them efficiently, and fine-tune their inquires using the most accurate data.
